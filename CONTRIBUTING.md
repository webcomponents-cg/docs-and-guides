# Contributor Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the [Web Components Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webcomponents/)!

Contributions to this repository are intended to become part of documents governed by the: 

  * [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20200915/)
  * [Software and Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software)

To make substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate
in the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.

## Issue disclosure and discussion

The first step for any substantive contribution is to either:

  1. [Find an existing issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues) directly related to the contribution
  2. [Add a new issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/new)

Issues are where individual reports and Community Group discussions come together such 
that the eventual consensus can be turned into official language.

## Normative and/or substantive contributions

The Web Components Community Group operates via the consensus of its membership, and discusses all significant matters prior to implementation.

<!-- @Westbrook would this be a good place to include the working group meeting links and cadence details?

The Working Group, aside from managing issues on GitHub, mainly discusses
specifications and requests on [the www-style public mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/),
and in CSSWG meetings, whose minutes are posted to www-style. -->

### Contribution

Please follow the [Pull Request template](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) when contributing to the repository.

## Non-substantive contributions

For simple spelling, grammar, or markup fixes unrelated to the substance of a
specification, issuing a pull request without a corresponding issue is acceptable.
