# Contributor Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the [Web Components Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webcomponents/)!

Contributions to this repository are intended to become part of documents governed by the:

  * [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20200915/)
  * [Software and Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software)

To make substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate
in the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.

## Issue disclosure and discussion

The first step for any substantive contribution is to either:

  1. [Find an existing issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues) directly related to the contribution
  2. [Add a new issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/new)

Issues are where individual reports and Community Group discussions come together such
that the eventual consensus can be turned into official language.

## Goals and Non-Goals

The main goal of the Web Components Community Group docs-and-guides effort is to provide explaination, advocacy, and documentation of shared web components concepts in a common location that is not tied to any specific web components library.

This documentation should be ideal for readers interested in learning about web components first - before thinking about libraries; and for web component libraries to reference to cover the standard web components foundations without writing it all themselves.

### Goals
* Provide a polished landing page for web components, similar in spirit to homepages for frameworks.
* Explain what web components are and why they are useful
* Advocate for web components in a library-neutral way
* Document core web component technical concepts
* Educate readers on useful library-agnostic patterns and best practices
* Orient readers to the broader web components ecosystem, including standards work, resources, communities, libraries, tools, and components.

### Non-Goals
* Duplicate MDN references of the web components APIs
* Document or advocate specific web components libraries

## Normative and/or substantive contributions

The Web Components Community Group operates via the consensus of its membership, and discusses all significant matters prior to implementation.

Aside from managing issues and PRs on GitHub, the Community Group discusses recommendations, goals, and planning via events available on [this shared calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=o25bim5rvcu42mfnqilirpmp44@group.calendar.google.com).

### Contribution

Please follow the [Pull Request template](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) when contributing to the repository.

## Non-substantive contributions

For simple spelling, grammar, or markup fixes unrelated to the substance of a
specification, issuing a pull request without a corresponding issue is acceptable.
